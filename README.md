Creating this because I'm getting tired of repeatedly doing this.

Pretty sure there are other really good templates out there...but this one is mine and I like it, but more specifically - 'cause I'll be adding stuff that I find myself using often or stuff that improves it in my opinion.



I'm by no means a 'Senior developer' or that kinda thing...so if you find yourself laughing at my code - stop...pls... ._.

But if you happen to notice any major flaw, security/performance wise or see any way where I can improve this - feel free to open an issue, my guy.

If this actually helps you out, then more power to you bro üëç (...and me? I guess?)
